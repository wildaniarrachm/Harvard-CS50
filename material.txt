html has two basic lists
1. ordered list -> the items are in particular order
2. unordered list -> the items are not in particular order

Image

tag: <img> => single html element therefore it has no closing tag
img attributes:
1. src (source) => the source of your image you want to display
2. alt => text based description, in case if the web fail to render the image
3. width => to adjust the size of the image

Link
tag: <a> => short for anchor
attribute
1. href -> contains the attached link
inside of the tag, we'll have to make a content in which whenever
user click that content they will be directed to the attached link

Table

2. table body <tbody> -> consists of the contents <td> (table data) of the table
3. table row <tr>

CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)
- adding css to html
1. inline style => directly putting the style inside the element
2. internal style => adding style attributes to the DOM, exactly inside the head
3. external style => exporting style attributes from an external css file.

-Multiple element selector (h1, h2 {css attributes})
-id => selector tag: #id -> add a styling to certain elements with the specific id
-class => selector tag: .class -> giving styling to certain elements that belong to certain class
